# Rust Migration Plan for Tailscale MCP Server

This document outlines a detailed plan for migrating the existing TypeScript-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Tailscale to Rust, with the primary motivation being improved performance and efficiency.

### Overall Assessment of Difficulty

Changing this repository to Rust would be **moderately to highly difficult**. It's not a simple port, but a re-architecture and re-implementation. The difficulty stems from:

1. **Language Paradigm Shift:** Moving from a dynamic, garbage-collected language (TypeScript/JavaScript) to a statically-typed, memory-safe language (Rust) requires a different approach to data structures, error handling, and concurrency.
2. **Ecosystem Transition:** Replacing Node.js/TypeScript libraries (e.g., Express, Axios, Zod, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) with their Rust equivalents. While Rust has a rich ecosystem, direct one-to-one replacements might not always exist or behave identically.
3. **CLI/API Interaction:** Re-implementing the logic for interacting with the Tailscale CLI (parsing output) and REST API (HTTP requests, JSON serialization/deserialization) in Rust.
4. **MCP Server Implementation:** The core of this project is an MCP server. Re-implementing the MCP SDK in Rust or finding a compatible Rust library would be a major task.

### Proposed Plan for Rust Migration

The migration would involve several phases, focusing on building the new Rust application incrementally while ensuring core functionalities are preserved.

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Services

* **Goal:** Establish the basic Rust project structure and re-implement fundamental services like logging and configuration.
* **Steps:**
    1. Initialize a new Rust project using `cargo new tailscale-mcp-server-rs`.
    2. Define project dependencies in `Cargo.toml` (e.g., `tokio` for async runtime, `tracing` for logging, `serde` for serialization/deserialization, `dotenv` for environment variables).
    3. Re-implement the logging utility (currently `src/logger.ts`) using a Rust logging framework like `tracing` or `log` with a `fern` or `env_logger` backend.
    4. Set up environment variable loading (similar to `dotenv` in TypeScript).

#### Phase 2: MCP Server & Tool Dispatch

* **Goal:** Re-implement the core MCP server logic and the mechanism for dispatching requests to specific tools.
* **Steps:**
    1. **MCP SDK Equivalent:** Investigate or develop a Rust equivalent for the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. This might involve creating a custom implementation to handle MCP message parsing and response formatting.
    2. **Server Implementation:** Choose a Rust web framework (e.g., `actix-web`, `warp`, or `axum`) to handle incoming HTTP requests for the MCP server.
    3. **Tool Registration & Dispatch:** Design a system in Rust to register and dispatch calls to different "tools" (e.g., `list_devices`, `device_action`), mirroring the modular structure in `src/tools/`.

#### Phase 3: Tailscale Integrations

* **Goal:** Re-implement the interaction with the Tailscale CLI and REST API.
* **Steps:**
    1. **CLI Integration:**
        * Use Rust's `std::process::Command` to execute Tailscale CLI commands (e.g., `tailscale status`, `tailscale up`).
        * Implement robust parsing of CLI output, potentially using regex or structured parsing libraries, to extract necessary information.
    2. **API Integration:**
        * Use a Rust HTTP client library (e.g., `reqwest`) to make requests to the Tailscale REST API.
        * Define Rust structs that mirror the Tailscale API response structures, leveraging `serde` for automatic JSON serialization/deserialization.
        * Implement error handling for API calls.

#### Phase 4: Tool Re-implementation

* **Goal:** Translate each existing TypeScript tool into its Rust equivalent, including input validation.
* **Steps:**
    1. **Data Schemas:** Re-define the input and output schemas for each tool using Rust structs, leveraging `serde` for serialization/deserialization and potentially a validation library (e.g., `validator` or custom `impl Validate` blocks). This replaces the `zod` schemas.
    2. **Tool Logic:** Re-implement the business logic for each tool (e.g., `acl-tools`, `admin-tools`, `device-tools`, `network-tools`) in Rust, utilizing the CLI and API integration components developed in Phase 3.
    3. **Error Handling:** Implement Rust's idiomatic error handling (e.g., `Result` enum with custom error types) for all tool operations.

#### Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance

* **Goal:** Ensure the new Rust application is robust and functionally equivalent to the TypeScript version.
* **Steps:**
    1. **Unit Tests:** Write comprehensive unit tests for individual Rust functions and modules using Rust's built-in testing framework.
    2. **Integration Tests:** Develop integration tests that simulate MCP requests and verify the end-to-end functionality, including interactions with the Tailscale CLI and API.
    3. **Performance Benchmarking:** Conduct benchmarks to confirm the performance and efficiency improvements gained by switching to Rust.

#### Phase 6: Build, Packaging & Documentation

* **Goal:** Prepare the Rust application for deployment and update all relevant documentation.
* **Steps:**
    1. **Build Configuration:** Configure `Cargo.toml` for release builds, including optimizations.
    2. **Docker Integration:** Update the `Dockerfile` to build and run the Rust application. This will involve installing Rust toolchains and compiling the application within the Docker image.
    3. **Deployment Scripts:** Adjust any existing deployment scripts (e.g., `scripts/publish.sh`) to handle the Rust binary.
    4. **Documentation Update:** Update the `README.md` and other documentation files (e.g., `docs/docker.md`, `docs/workflows.md`) to reflect the change to Rust, including new setup, development, and deployment instructions.
